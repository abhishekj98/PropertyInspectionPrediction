A Fortune 100 company, Liberty Mutual Insurance has provided a wide range of insurance products and services designed to meet their customers' ever-changing needs for over 100 years.

To ensure that Liberty Mutual’s portfolio of home insurance policies aligns with their business goals, many newly insured properties receive a home inspection. These inspections review the condition of key attributes of the property, including things like the foundation, roof, windows and siding. The results of an inspection help Liberty Mutual determine if the property is one they want to insure.

In this challenge, your task is to predict a transformed count of hazards or pre-existing damages using a dataset of property information. This will enable Liberty Mutual to more accurately identify high risk homes that require additional examination to confirm their insurability.

Liberty Mutual is interested in hiring predictive modelers like you to work on one of many growing analytics teams within our company. As a member of Liberty Mutual’s advanced analytics community, you will have the opportunity to apply sophisticated, cutting-edge techniques, similar to those used in this competition, to large data sets in departments such as Actuarial, Product, Claims, Marketing, Distribution, Human Resources, and Finance.
